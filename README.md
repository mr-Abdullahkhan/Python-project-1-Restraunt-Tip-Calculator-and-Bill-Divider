💰 Tip Calculator & Bill Divider (Python)
=============================================================================================

This is my first Python project — a simple command-line program that calculates the total restaurant bill including tip and divides it equally among a given number of people.

=============================================================================================

📌 Project Description

The program asks the user to:

1. Enter the final restaurant bill amount

2. Choose a tip percentage

3. Enter the number of people splitting the bill

It then:

* Calculates the tip

* Adds it to the bill

* Divides the total amount fairly among all people

This project helped me practice Python basics such as user input, variables, calculations, and logical flow.

=============================================================================================

🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3

* Command Line / Terminal

=============================================================================================

▶️ How It Works

1. User inputs the bill amount

2. User selects the tip percentage

3. User enters the number of people

4. Program outputs the amount each person has to pay

=============================================================================================

🧮 Example

    Enter the total bill: 1500
    Enter tip percentage: 10
    Enter number of people: 3
    
    Each person should pay: 550

🎯 What I Learned

* Taking user input in Python

* Performing arithmetic operations

* Working with percentages

* Writing clear and logical code

* Building a complete working program from scratch

=============================================================================================

🚀 Future Improvements

* Input validation (handle incorrect inputs)

* Rounding amounts to two decimal places

* Adding multiple tip options

* Creating a graphical interface (GUI)
